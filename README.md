# INTEGRATIVE-PROJECT-DOCUMENTATION

## Overview
<span style="color:blue">This project aims to develop a mobile app focused on increasing women's safety by providing immediate support in emergency situations. The main objective is to share real-time location information with trusted contacts through a dedicated panic button. The app addresses the need for proactive safety measures by offering a key feature: a safety map that informs users of streets with high and low incidences of crime, robberies, and other related incidents, enabling safer route planning.</span>
